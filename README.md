# Trump-speech-generation-with-GPT-2
Donald Trump speech generation using the small version of the GPT-2
The database has been taken from FactBase. You can find in the repository 2 files; one for training and one for text 
generation using the trained weigths. Both use huggingface GPT-2(https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-pretrained-BERT) and 
the train file is partially based on the TF version of nshepperd(https://github.com/nshepperd/gpt-2/tree/finetuning)
